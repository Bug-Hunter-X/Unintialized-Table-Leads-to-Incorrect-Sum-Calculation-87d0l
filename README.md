This repository contains a COBOL program with a common error involving the use of tables. The program attempts to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a table. However, the table is not properly initialized, resulting in an incorrect sum. The solution demonstrates how to properly initialize and use the table to obtain the correct result.
